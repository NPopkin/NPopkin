### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Naomi!

I just recieved my Masters in Mathematics (with emphasis on Applied Math) from Purdue University and a Dual Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science & Mathematics from University of Pennsylvania.

Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/NPopkin/Portfolio) for some new projects I have been working on. 

In my free time, I love to hike with my dog, photograph cool nature and cook anything and everything!
